# EXT2 Corruption Recovery

A corruption recovery program for the ext2 filesystem.

Note: from the Question.pdf, "Bitmap Recovery" and "User Confirmation" have been implemented, however "Pointer Recovery" has not been implemented.


## How to run

In the "code" folder, in a shell run: `./recext2fs`, to find out more about how to give the filesystem as input, refer to "Question.pdf".

To run a set of pre-defined inputs automatically for grading, use the grader in the "grader" folder.
